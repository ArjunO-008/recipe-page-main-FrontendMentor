      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs<span>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
          You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</span></li>
        <li>Heat the pan<span>:  Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</span></li>
        <li>Cook the omelette<span>: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
          the eggs evenly coat the surface.</span></li>
        <li>Add fillings (optional)<span>: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
          middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</span></li>
        <li>Fold and serve<span>: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
          fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</span></li>
        <li>Enjoy<span>:  Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</span></li>
      </ol>
